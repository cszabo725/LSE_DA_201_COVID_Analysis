# LSE_DA_201_COVID_Analysis
This is a hypothetical project where we are analysing covid illness and vaccinations data to inform the UK government's vaccine drive. In this assignment we review cases, hospitalisations, deaths and recovery data by UK province/state.  And try to understand relationships between this dataset and the vaccinations across these regions.  

The parameters of this project are to focus on highlighting areas with the largest number of people who have only received one dose of the vaccine, while avoiding those areas with the highest level of recoveries in the initial campaign.  

We also review tweets data to understand if covid is still a trending topic and if Twitter could potentially be a good advertising medium.
Included are:
- The underlying covid illness, vaccination, and tweets data
- A jupyter notebook with the code to analyse the data
- A report of the findings
- A presentation to stakeholders

Enjoy!
